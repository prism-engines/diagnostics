# PRISM Validation Roadmap

## Hard Science Benchmarks for Physics-Based Validation

**Goal**: Validate PRISM on problems with known physics/equations where ground truth is analytical or empirical — not ML benchmarks, but real science published in hard science literature.

**Why**: PRISM is not machine learning. It's measurement. Validation should come from physics, not ML competitions.

## Benchmark Categories

### Category 1: Classical Physics Systems (Chaotic Dynamics)

Known equations, testable dynamics, analytical ground truth.

#### 1.1 Lorenz System ⭐ PRIORITY

## Validation Protocol

For each benchmark:

### Step 1: Data Acquisition
- Download or generate data
- Document source and parameters
- No preprocessing (raw PRISM)

### Step 2: Run PRISM
- Standard PRISM pipeline
- No domain-specific tuning
- Document exact configuration

### Step 3: Compare to Ground Truth
- Known equations: Compare field topology to analytical structure
- Known events: Compare PRISM detection to labeled events
- Known parameters: Compare PRISM features to physical parameters

### Step 4: Document Results
- PRISM output
- Ground truth comparison
- Physics interpretation
- Limitations observed

---

## Success Criteria

### For a benchmark to "pass":

1. **Field topology makes physical sense**
   - Sources/sinks align with physical interpretation
   - Stress propagation matches known dynamics

2. **Quantitative agreement** (where applicable)
   - Correlation with ground truth > 0.7
   - Or: Correct regime detection > 80%

3. **No domain tuning required**
   - Same PRISM code as other domains
   - Physics emerges from data

---

## The Story (If This Works)

```
"PRISM validated on:

 - NASA turbofan data (engineering)
 - Tennessee Eastman (chemical engineering)  
 - Lorenz system (physics)
 - Lotka-Volterra (biology)
 - Chemical kinetics (chemistry)
 - Seismic data (geophysics)

 Same math. No domain tuning. Physics emerges.

 This is not a machine learning method.
 This is a measurement framework."
```

**That's the Santa Fe talk.**
**That's the arXiv paper.**
**That's the NASA SBIR.**

## Notes

### What We're NOT Doing
- ML benchmark competitions (different game)
- Finance/economics data (Fidelity concerns)
- Anything requiring domain-specific preprocessing

### What We ARE Doing
- Physics validation with known ground truth
- Cross-domain proof of concept
- Interpretable results that match theory
